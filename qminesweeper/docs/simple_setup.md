### Game Rules

TBW

<!-- Choose the **board size**, the **number of bombs**, and a **difficulty level**.

- Difficulty controls which moves are allowed and the level of entanglement.  
- Example:  
  - Lv 0 = Identify bombs using $M, P$, no entanglement.  
  - Lv 1 = Clear with single-qubit gates, entanglement = 1.  

$$
\text{Expected Bombs} = \sum_i p_i
