### Game Rules

TBW
<!-- 
In this mode you can configure everything manually:

- Board rows and columns
- Number of bombs
- Entanglement level ($0 \leq E \leq 10$)
- Win condition (Identify, Clear, or Sandbox)
- Allowed move set (Classical, one-qubit, two-qubit)

This gives full control, closer to "quantum tomography" experiments. -->
