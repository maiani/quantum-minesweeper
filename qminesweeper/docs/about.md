## About Quantum Minesweeper

Quantum Minesweeper is a **quantum twist** on the classic game of Minesweeper. 
Instead of fixed mines, the board is prepared in **quantum states**:  
The player interacts with the board by **measuring qubits** or **applying quantum gates**, 
and must either *identify* or *clear* the “quantum mines.”

Quantum Minesweeper has been developed by researcher at the Nordic Institute of Theoretical Physics (Nordita) in Stockholm 
in 2025.
