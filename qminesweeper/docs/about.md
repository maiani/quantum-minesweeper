## About

*Quantum Minesweeper* is a **quantum twist** on the classic game of Minesweeper.  
Instead of fixed mines, the board is prepared in a superposition of different mine configurations.  
You interact with the board by **measuring** one cell, or by **applying quantum gates** 
and modify the boardto *defuse* the “quantum mines.”

Developed at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics ([Nordita](https://www.nordita.org)) in 2025, the project brings together a unified vision across gameplay, stabilizer mechanics, and the web/TUI interfaces.
