<h1> SY gate </h1>

<div>
  <p>
    The <strong>SY gate</strong> rotates by 90$^\circ$ about the "y-axis" defined by the states $|i\rangle$ and $|-i\rangle$:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    |0\rangle \to |+\rangle
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    |1\rangle \to |-\rangle
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be seen as the "square root" of the Y gate; applying it twice gives the same result as the Y gate.
