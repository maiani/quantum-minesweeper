<h1> SX gate </h1>

<div>
  <p>
    The <strong>SX gate</strong> rotates by 90$^\circ$ about the "x-axis" defined by the states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    |0\rangle \to |-i\rangle
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    |1\rangle \to |i\rangle
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be seen as the "square root" of the X gate; applying it twice gives the same result as the X gate.
  </p>
