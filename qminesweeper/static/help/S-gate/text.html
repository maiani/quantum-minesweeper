<h1> S gate </h1>

<div>
  <p>
    The <strong>S gate</strong> rotates by 90$^\circ$ about the "z-axis" defined by the states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    |0\rangle \to |0\rangle
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    |1\rangle \to |1\rangle
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be seen as the "square root" of the Z gate; applying it twice gives the same result as the Z gate.
  </p>
